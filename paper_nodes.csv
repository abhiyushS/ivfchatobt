10.1186/s13063-025-08750-9,Non-inferiority study to compare the efficacy of relugolix with dienogest for endometriosis-associated pain and usefulness of administering relugolix prior to dienogest (READY study): study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled study.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis presents as endometrial tissue growths outside the uterine cavity with its major symptoms including dysmenorrhea and infertility. Progestin preparations, such as dienogest, are the first-line therapy for endometriosis symptoms, but may cause abnormal uterine bleeding. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist may also be used to ease symptoms, but may induce flare-ups. Relugolix is a non-peptide GnRH antagonist that does not induce flare-ups. This study aims to compare the efficacy of relugolix with that of dienogest for reducing endometriosis-associated pain, and to evaluate if relugolix, administered prior to dienogest, decreases abnormal uterine bleeding.
A multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority randomized study will be conducted at 11 sites in Japan. A total of 100 premenopausal patients aged ≥ 18 years with endometriosis, a maximum visual analog scale (VAS) score > 30 for endometriosis-associated pain, and dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain of at least moderate severity on the Biberoglu & Behrman (B&B) scale will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either a relugolix group or dienogest group. Patients in the relugolix group will receive 40 mg oral relugolix once daily for 16 weeks, followed by 1 mg oral dienogest twice daily for 24 weeks. Patients in the dienogest group will receive oral dienogest 1 mg twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary outcome will be change in maximum VAS score for endometriosis-associated pain from baseline to 13-16 weeks after start of treatment. The secondary outcomes will include VAS score for dyspareunia, B&B score for dysmenorrhea, severity of induration in the pouch of Douglas, restricted uterine mobility, pelvic tenderness, quality of life, analgesic use, and ovarian endometrioma diameter. The safety outcomes will include treatment-emergent adverse events, bone density, bone markers, menstrual status, genital bleeding, and endometrial thickness.
This study will determine the efficacy of relugolix for improving endometriosis-associated pain and dienogest-induced abnormal uterine bleeding. The results will support treatment decisions regarding endometriosis-associated pain, and the introduction of new treatments to reduce dienogest-induced abnormal uterine bleeding.

Symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility significantly impair quality of life. Among therapeutic options, progestogens have demonstrated efficacy in managing pain and reducing recurrence rates. This study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of progestogens versus combined oral contraceptive pills in alleviating pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and associated side effects.
A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with the last search conducted in October 2024. The review was registered under PROSPERO registration number CRD42024609658. Studies were included regardless of language, publication year, or country. Articles not comparing progestogens and combined oral contraceptives or lacking relevant outcomes were excluded, as were abstracts, theses, case reports, opinion pieces, and correspondence. Risk of bias was assessed using the modified Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 for randomized studies.
Seven studies, including 948 patients (476 receiving progestogens), met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis found no significant differences between progestogens and COCPs for pelvic pain (SMD = 0.02; 95 % CI: -0.37 to 0.40; P = 0.04; I
Progestogens and COCPs demonstrate comparable efficacy in managing pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and psychological health, with similar side effect profiles. These findings suggest both treatments are equally effective options for symptom management in endometriosis.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2025-01-26 00:00:00,"['Giovanade Souza Gaio', 'FredericoKemczenski', 'WellgnerFernandes Oliveira Amador', 'Caroline FreitasFarias', 'JúneaChagas']"
10.18502/jri.v25i3.17016,Cervical Anatomical Characteristics in Women with Endometriosis: A Diagnostic Approach.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis is a gynecologic disorder which causes dysmenorrhea and infertility. Early diagnosis of endometriosis can help prevent the necessity for invasive diagnostic procedures. Medical imaging has been widely utilized to diagnose various diseases without the need for invasive procedures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cervical length in women with endometriosis.
In this case-control study, the case group consisted of nulliparous women with endometriosis, while the control group comprised nulliparous women without endometriosis. A total of 42 individuals were included in each group. Cervical length was measured using transvaginal ultrasound from the external os to the internal os. The patients in the case group underwent laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. Pearson chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were employed to compare categorical variables with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant.
In both groups, there were no notable variations in any of the demographic characteristics. However, the severity of dysmenorrhea was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.01). The average diameter of the mediolateral cervix (29.48±6.2 and 27.14±3.8) was statistically significant between the patient group and control group, respectively (p=0.04). The mediolateral width may have a positive predictive effect on the presence of endometriosis, while cervical length appears to have a protective effect against endometriosis.
Demographic data do not predict endometriosis. This study suggests that mediolateral width in transvaginal sonography can serve as a minimally invasive diagnostic tool for endometriosis, showing correlation with endometriosis symptoms like dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia.",Journal of reproduction & infertility,2025-01-20 00:00:00,"['ElaheAfshari', 'RoyaDerakhshan', 'ShahlaChaichian', 'Seyed RezaSaadat Mostafavi', 'ShimaGhafourian Noroozi', 'SamanehRokhgireh', 'AbolfazlMehdizadehkashi', 'BabakSabet', 'MohannaKhandan']"

This review explores the intricate connection between EMS- associated pain and SD, focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dysmenorrhea in EMS. Key contributors to pain include inflammation, aberrant immune responses, neurogenic inflammation, peritoneal irritation, peripheral sensitization, central sensitization and cross-organ sensitization. Understanding the pain pathways in EMS highlights the complexity of symptom manifestation and underscores the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach to management. Clinical manifestations, including chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, infertility, gastrointestinal and bladder symptoms, fatigue and malaise, are discussed, emphasizing the diverse impact of EMS on women's health. Various treatment modalities, ranging from pharmacological interventions to surgical and complementary approaches, are outlined to provide comprehensive management strategies for EMS-related menstrual pain/SD.

10.1186/s12905-024-03527-9,Prevalence of endometriosis in women undergoing laparoscopic surgery for various gynecological indications: a Jordanian multi-center retrospective study.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis, a condition that significantly impacts the quality of life for affected women, manifests with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility. A previous single-center study suggested an elevated prevalence of endometriosis in Jordan, prompting the need for larger studies to confirm these findings.
We conducted a cross-sectional study involving a sample of 866 women who underwent various laparoscopic procedures for different indications at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Jordan University Hospital and Al-Karak Governmental Hospital, two tertiary referral hospitals in Jordan between January 2015 and March 2023.
Our study included 866 patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery between 2015 and 2023, with a mean age of 33.80 ± 7.7 years. Of these, 89 women were diagnosed with endometriosis, resulting in an overall prevalence of 10.3%. Diagnostic laparoscopy was the most common procedure, performed on 28.4% of patients. Infertility was the most common indication, observed in 34.5% of patients. Endometriosis was significantly more prevalent in patients with chronic pelvic pain (29.7%) and less prevalent in those seeking treatment for infertility (13.8%), ectopic pregnancy (1.1%), and family planning (0%). Endometriosis was significantly less prevalent in patients undergoing laparoscopic salpingectomy or salpingostomy (3.7%). Backstep-wise multivariate regression analysis suggested that endometriosis may be associated with higher age (OR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.07, p = 0.027), lower BMI (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.87 to 0.98, p = 0.007), lower number of parities (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.6 to 0.86, p < 0.001), and fewer cesarean sections (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.32 to 0.87, p = 0.013).
This is the most extensive Jordanian study assessing the prevalence of endometriosis in women undergoing gynecological laparoscopy. Our results suggest that the prevalence of endometriosis among Jordanian women remains high, albeit lower than previously reported. The study uncovered that age, BMI, parity number, and cesarean sections are predictors of endometriosis.

The characteristic ectopic lesions are marked by a widely spread dense fibrotic interstitium comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibers, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis. Fibrosis is now recognized as a critical component of endometriosis because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or noncyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root causes, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, hinders early diagnosis and implement effective therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Emerging research offer a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is believed to be tightly linked to pain, a primary contributor to the deterioration of the patient's quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways behind endometriosis-associated fibrosis are poorly addressed. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease limiting the treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article focuses on recent developments in the field and highlight the necessity for novel fibrotic models for early diagnosis, a better understanding the disease's etiology and develop effective anti-fibrotic treatments.

10.7759/cureus.71772,Prevalence and Risk Factors of Endometriosis Among Infertile Women in a Tertiary Care Center in South India.,ResearchPaper,"Background Endometriosis is a gynecological conundrum because of its challenging diagnosis and treatment. It seems to affect every aspect of a woman's reproductive system, rendering her incapable of conceiving or achieving a successful pregnancy outcome independently. This study sought to determine the prevalence of endometriosis and clinical attributes of infertile women undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy. Methodology The current research is an analytical cross-sectional study that was carried out from April 2017 to December 2018. We included 103 women diagnosed with infertility and who underwent laparoscopy in the fertility center at Government Medical College Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, a southern state of India. A semistructured questionnaire was used to collect information on the sociodemographic, menstrual, and reproductive characteristics. Family history and associated symptoms of endometriosis were elicited. Patients were put into four stages by the revised American Fertility Society (rAFS) grading, which was used for the laparoscopic staging. Results Among the 103 cases who underwent laparoscopy, 23 patients (22.3%) were diagnosed with endometriosis. Of the 23 cases of endometriosis, one (4.3%) had minimal endometriosis, two (8.7%) had mild endometriosis, and 10 (43.5%) each had moderate and severe endometriosis. Dysmenorrhea was significantly more prevalent among cases (87%, 20 participants) compared to controls (48.8%, 39 participants) (p = 0.001). Approximately 56.5% (13 participants) of cases had dyspareunia, compared to only 31.3% (25 participants) of controls, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.027). About 52.2% of the cases (12 participants) experienced premenstrual spotting, while none of the controls did. The p-value of 0.001 shows a statistically significant difference. Out of the total cases examined, 56.5% (13 participants) reached menarche at or before 12 years, whereas 43.5% (10 participants) attained it after reaching the age of 12. Among the control group, 31.2% (25 participants) of individuals had menarche at or before the age of 12, while 68.8% (55 participants) experienced it later. The difference that was observed had a statistically significant result (p = 0.027). The majority of cases (about 65.2%) experienced cycles lasting less than 21 days, with 30.4% having cycles within the normal range, and 4.3% experiencing cycles longer than 35 days. The significant difference in proportion is evident with a p-value of 0.015. Out of the cases, around 34.8% (eight participants) had a history of pelvic surgery. Compared to the control group, nearly 30.4% of the cases (seven participants) had a positive family history of endometriosis. There were no additional risk factors associated with the development of endometriosis. Conclusion The prevalence of endometriosis among infertile women undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy was more than one-fifth of the study patients. The common complaints were dysmenorrhea, followed by dyspareunia and premenstrual spotting. Risk factors associated with endometriosis were early menarche, frequent cycles, and positive family history.",Cureus,2024-11-19 00:00:00,"['NimmiVarghese', 'IndhumathiShanmugam', 'HariniSivamani', 'AnithaDurairaj']"

Endometriomas are a form of endometriosis and are characterized by cystic masses most commonly found on the ovaries. This case discusses the management of a rare occurrence of a 25-cm endometrioma in a patient without a prior diagnosis of endometriosis, who presented to the emergency room in an acute hypertensive emergency. It is believed that the large cyst caused a mass effect against renal vasculature precipitating renovascular hypertension that required immediate intervention.

Eleven years prior, the patient had undergone left ovarian cystectomy for treatment of endometrioma, as well as excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis. The oocyte retrieval procedure, where more than 30 eggs were retrieved, was complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and intraperitoneal bleeding, which necessitated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 3 days. Following discharge from the ICU, the patient experienced occasional on-and-off pressure of the urinary bladder and persistent aching pelvic pain.
At the 1-month follow-up appointment, the patient's vital signs were assessed (blood pressure, 142/94 mm Hg; pulse rate, 95 per minute; temperature, 96.8 °F [36 °C]). Routine blood investigations, including white blood cell count, were within normal limits. Physical examination showed the abdomen was soft but there was mild pelvic tenderness. The serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin test result was negative for pregnancy, and urinalysis testing showed no leukocyte esterase or nitrites.

10.1093/nutrit/nuae120,Eating for Optimization: Unraveling the Dietary Patterns and Nutritional Strategies in Endometriosis Management.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disorder affecting millions of women worldwide, causing chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility, and severely impacting their quality of life. Treatment primarily involves hormonal therapies and surgical excision, but high recurrence rates and the economic burden are substantial. With these challenges, significant discussion surrounds the potential role of dietary patterns in managing endometriosis, making it necessary to bridge this critical gap. This review investigates the current scientific evidence on the dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean, vegetarian, anti-inflammatory, low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols [low-FODMAP], and Western-style diets) associated with endometriosis and provides a concise, yet thorough, overview on the subject. In addition, antioxidants, microbiota, and artificial intelligence (AI) and their potential roles were also evaluated as future directions. An electronic-based search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus, and Web of Science. The current data on the topic indicate that a diet based on the Mediterranean and anti-inflammatory diet pattern, rich in dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, plant-based protein, and vitamins and minerals, has a positive influence on endometriosis, yielding a promising improvement in patient symptoms. Preclinical investigations and clinical trials indicate that dietary antioxidants and gut microbiota modulation present potential new approaches in managing endometriosis. Also, AI may offer a promising avenue to explore how dietary components interact with endometriosis. Ultimately, considering genetic and lifestyle factors, a healthy, balanced, personalized approach to diet may offer valuable insights on the role of diet as a means of symptom improvement, facilitating the utilization of nutrition for the management of endometriosis.",Nutrition reviews,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"['İnciTürkoğlu', 'Koray GorkemSacinti', 'AndreaPanattoni', 'AhmetNamazov', 'Nazlı TuncaSanlier', 'NevinSanlier', 'VitoCela']"

Despite its ubiquity, the management of endometriosis is challenging due to its heterogeneous presentation, limitations in diagnostic methods, variable therapeutic responses, and personal and socio-cultural impact on quality of life. This review attempts to consolidate the current literature on endometriosis occurring during and beyond menopause, and to present details regarding management strategies that take into account individual outcomes and goals when managing this condition. The topics included in this review are the clinical features and differential diagnosis of pelvic pain in postmenopausal patients, imaging considerations, serum and laboratory biomarkers, indications for surgery, the principles of hormone replacement therapy, the de novo development of endometriosis after menopause, and malignant transformation. Each topic includes a summary of the current literature, utilizing clinical research, case reports, and expert opinion. Despite a better understanding of the impact of endometriosis beyond menopause, there are many limitations to this condition, specifically with regard to cancer risk and indications for surgery. The existing evidence supports the use of shared decision making and the incorporation of patient preferences in guiding clinical management.

Materials and Methods: The multicenter cohort study was performed partly as a cross-sectional study to estimate occurrence of endometriosis, partly as a case-control study to look for factors associated with endometriosis. The study was carried out during the period from January 1st, 2019 to December 31st, 2021.This study included adolescent girls and adult women from 15 Ukrainian regions.
Results: Among 15,458 patients, 4,397 (28.4%) endometriosis were observed. Of all endometriosis cases, 48.5% were peritoneal/superf i cial endometriosis (SPE), 34.6% were ovarian endometriotic cyst/endometrioma (OMA), and 16.9% were deep inf i ltrating endometriosis (DIE). The prevalence of the three types of endometriosis was: SPE, 13.8%; OMA, 9.8%; and DIE, 4.8%. The factors associated with an increased risk for endometriosis include age 23-32 years, parity (small number of births), age of fi rst sexual intercourse <20 years, history of healthcare-associated infection after gynecological surgery (pelvic abscess or cellulitis, salpingitis and oophoritis), history of infertility, early menarche (before the age of 11), dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, intermenstrual bleeding, heavy uterine bleeding and dysmenorrhea, and heavy uterine bleeding.
Conclusions: Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease in Ukraine and the relative frequency of dif f erent types of endometriosis: the most common were ovarian and peritoneal endometriosis.

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (r-ASRM) classification, have limitations, particularly in preoperative settings. The Numerical Multi-Scoring System of Endometriosis (NMS-E) has been proposed to address these shortcomings by providing a comprehensive preoperative diagnostic tool that integrates findings from pelvic examinations and transvaginal ultrasonography.
This retrospective study aims to validate the effectiveness of the NMS-E in predicting surgical outcomes and correlating with the severity of endometriosis. Data from 111 patients at Nippon Medical School Hospital were analyzed to determine the correlation between NMS-E scores, including E-score-a severity indicator-traditional scoring systems, surgical duration, blood loss, and clinical symptoms. This study also examined the need to refine parameters for deep endometriosis within the NMS-E to enhance its predictive accuracy for disease severity.
The mean age of the patient cohort was 35.1 years, with the majority experiencing symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the NMS-E's E-score and the severity of endometriosis, particularly in predicting surgical duration (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.724,

She underwent a hysteroscopy and laparoscopic excision of the cyst at the site of the cesarean scar with the repair of the cesarean scar defect. Diagnosis of scar endometriosis was confirmed on histopathology. She successfully became pregnant after one year and had a full-term pregnancy and delivered via cesarean section. Cesarean scar defect, also known as isthmocele, emerges as a notable complication following cesarean delivery, often linked with secondary infertility. Other associated complications of scar defect are prolonged menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain. The laparoscopic reparation of the uterine scar defect proves to be a successful approach in addressing secondary infertility and subfertility issues. Individuals with a prior cesarean section history, expressing concerns about secondary infertility and distressing complaints, require a thorough examination of the uterine scar before embarking on future pregnancy plans. Scar endometriosis is an uncommon medical condition and can worsen patient symptoms and lead to further complications. Diagnosis is often established following the excision of the lesion and subsequent histopathological examination. Prompt management can relieve patient symptoms and prevent further complications.",Cureus,2024-03-25 00:00:00,"['JijishaAli', 'GazalaKhan', 'YevginiyKaramurzin', 'RidaMaryum', 'SamiTalo']"

Many experience debilitating symptoms including pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Current treatment options are limited in preserving fertility, with many opting for sterilizing hysterectomy as a form of treatment. Currently, surgical interventions include hysterectomy, myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization in addition to endometrial ablation to control AUB. Non-surgical hormonal interventions, including GnRH agonists, are connotated with negative side effects and are unacceptable for women desiring fertility. Periostin, a regulatory extra cellular matrix (ECM) protein, has been found to be expressed in various gynecological diseases including leiomyomas. We previously determined that periostin over-expression in immortalized myometrial cells led to the development of a leiomyoma-like cellular phenotype. Periostin is induced by TGF-β, signals through the PI3K/AKT pathway, induces collagen production, and mediates wound repair and fibrosis, all of which are implicated in leiomyoma pathology. Periostin has been linked to other gynecological diseases including ovarian cancer and endometriosis and is being investigated as pharmacological target for treating ovarian cancer, post-surgical scarring, and numerous other fibrotic conditions. In this review, we provide discussion linking pathological inflammation and wound repair, with a TGF-β-periostin-collagen signaling in the pathogenesis of leiomyomas, and ultimately the potential of periostin as a druggable target to treat leiomyomas.",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,2024-03-05 00:00:00,"['Zahra GKiesler', 'Mark IHunter', 'Ahmed ZBalboula', 'Amanda LPatterson']"

Recent studies have shown that chronic inflammation occurs in the pelvis of endometriosis patients and that this inflammation is exacerbated by immunosuppression, leading to survival endometrial debris. However, the detailed immunological mechanisms underlying the aggravation of inflammation and immunosuppression in endometriosis patients remain unclear.
We investigate the alarmins (high-mobility group box-1, IL-33, IL-1α, and S100B protein), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β), and immune cells (CD8
Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between each alarmin level and aggravating indicators. However, the expression of pattern recognition receptors, toll-like receptor 4, and receptor of advanced glycation end-products on macrophages was inversely correlated with aggravating indicators.
The aggravation of endometriosis is associated with a decrease in alarmin receptors but not alarmin levels.

Although treatment options for endometriosis alleviate this pain, approximately one-third of women still experience pain even after receiving treatment, indicating the need for novel approaches to pain relief in those women. The Angel Touch device (AT-04) is a portable magnetic fields irradiation device that incorporates a combination of mixed alternative magnetic fields at 2 kHz and 83.3 MHz. A phase III trial confirmed the efficacy and safety of AT-02, a prototype of AT-04, for pain relief in patients with fibromyalgia.
This is a phase III, multicenter, prospective, randomized, sham device-controlled, double-blind, parallel study. The participants will be premenopausal women aged > 18 years who have endometriosis-related pain with at least moderate severity. Considering dropouts, 50 participants have been deemed appropriate. Eligible women will be centrally registered, and the data center will randomly allocate them in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control groups. Women in the intervention group will receive electromagnetic wave irradiation generated by AT-04 and those who in the control group will wear a sham device for 16 weeks, and both groups will wear AT-04 for another 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the change in the Numeric Rating Scale score at 16 weeks compared with the baseline. Secondary outcome measures are efficacy for pelvic pain including dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pain, and chronic pelvic pain not related to menstruation, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, and improvement of quality of life during the study period. Safety will be evaluated by device defects and the frequency of adverse events. The study protocol has been approved by the Clinical Study Review Board of Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan, and will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Japanese Clinical Trials Act and relevant notifications.
This study aims to develop a novel method of managing endometriosis-related pain. The AT-04 is an ultralow-invasive device that can be used without inhibiting ovulation, suggesting potential benefits to women of reproductive-age. Trial registration number Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs032230278).
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that negatively impacts reproductive health via endometriosis-related pain, infertility, and endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer. Although current therapeutic options for endometriosis are effective for the endometriosis-related pain, approximately one-third of women still experience pain even after receiving treatment, indicating the need for novel approaches to pain relief in those women. This is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel portable pain management device, AT-04, that incorporates a combination of mixed alternating magnetic fields, for endometriosis-related pain. This is a multicenter, prospective, sham device-controlled, double-blind, parallel study. Enrolled women will have undergone standard hormonal treatment for endometriosis at baseline, and this allows for assessing whether the device remains effective when used in conjunction with existing treatment methods. The study also will explore the impact of AT-04 on reducing the size of ovarian endometriotic cysts that reflect the activity of endometriosis. The study reflects the strong desire by physicians to liberate women from the unbearable pain associated with endometriosis. The sole efficacy of AT-04 in treating endometriosis-related pain is difficult to evaluate as there is a possibility that menstrual cycles may influence the assessment of pain and quality of life. However, the study findings regarding the effectiveness of AT-04 for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain may benefit women with endometriosis who have pain that is not effectively relieved by other treatments. Consequently, it may contribute to the improvement of reproductive health within society.",Reproductive health,2024-01-27 00:00:00,"['HiroshiIshikawa', 'OsamuYoshino', 'FuminoriTaniguchi', 'TasukuHarada', 'MikioMomoeda', 'YutakaOsuga', 'TamikiHikake', 'YoukoHattori', 'MichikoHanawa', 'YosukeInaba', 'HidekiHanaoka', 'KaoriKoga']"

There is a potential association between endometriosis and an increased susceptibility for Sjögren's syndrome (SS). SS is a common chronic, inflammatory, systemic, autoimmune, multifactorial disease of complex pathology, with genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors contributing to the development of this condition. It occurs in 0.5‑1% of the population, is characterized by the presence of ocular dryness, lymphocytic infiltrations and contributes to neurological, gastrointestinal, vascular and dermatological manifestations. Endometriosis is an inflammatory, estrogen‑dependent, multifactorial, heterogeneous gynecological disease, affecting ≤10% of reproductive‑age women. It is characterized by the occurrence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, mainly in the pelvic cavity, and is associated with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia and either subfertility or infertility. It is still unclear whether SS appears as a secondary response to endometriosis, or it is developed due to any potential shared mechanisms of these conditions.

A retrospective cohort study.
This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.
A total of consecutive 1365 patients with infertility who underwent laparoscopy between January 2013 and August 2020 were divided into a training set (n = 910) for developing the predictive model and a validation set (n = 455) to confirm the model's prediction efficiency. The patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio.
Sensitivities, specificities, area under the curve, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test, Net Reclassification Improvement index, and Integrated Discrimination Improvement index were evaluated in the training set to select the optimum model. In the validation set, the model's discriminations, calibrations, and clinical use were tested for validation.
In the training set, there were 587 patients with minimal or mild endometriosis and 323 patients without endometriosis. The combination of clinical parameters in the model was evaluated for both statistical and clinical significance. The best-performing model ultimately included body mass index, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, uterosacral tenderness, and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). The nomogram based on this model demonstrated sensitivities of 87.7% and 93.3%, specificities of 68.6% and 66.4%, and area under the curve of 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.81-0.87) and 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.80-0.89) for the training and validation sets, respectively. Calibration curves and decision curve analyses also indicated that the model had good calibration and clinical value. Uterosacral tenderness emerged as the most valuable predictor.
This study successfully developed a predictive model with high accuracy in identifying infertile women with minimal or mild endometriosis based on clinical characteristics, signs, and cost-effective blood tests. This model would assist clinicians in screening infertile women for minimal or mild endometriosis, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2023-12-27 00:00:00,"['JieZhang', 'JingWang', 'JingyiZhang', 'JinLiu', 'YanhongXu', 'PeipeiZhu', 'LeiDai', 'LiShu', 'JinyongLiu', 'ZhenHou', 'FeiyangDiao', 'JiayinLiu', 'YundongMao']"

10.32007/jfacmedbagdad.552646",Estrobolome dysregulation is associated with altered immunometabolism in a mouse model of endometriosis.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis is a painful disease that affects around 5% of women of reproductive age. In endometriosis, ectopic endometrial cells or seeded endometrial debris grow in abnormal locations including the peritoneal cavity. Common manifestations of endometriosis include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain and often infertility and symptomatic relief or surgical removal are mainstays of treatment. Endometriosis both promotes and responds to estrogen imbalance, leading to intestinal bacterial estrobolome dysregulation and a subsequent induction of inflammation.
In the current study, we investigated the linkage between gut dysbiosis and immune metabolic response in endometriotic mice. Ovariectomized BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal transplantation of endometrial tissue from OVX donors (OVX+END). Control groups included naïve mice (Naïve), naïve mice that received endometrial transplants (Naive+END) and OVX mice that received the vehicle (OVX+VEH). Colonic content was collected 2 weeks post-transplantation for 16s rRNA pyrosequencing and peritoneal fluid was collected to determine the phenotype of inflammatory cells by flow cytometry.
We noted a significant increase in the number of peritoneal fluid cells, specifically, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NKT cells in OVX+END mice. Phylogenetic taxonomy analysis showed significant dysbiosis in OVX+END mice, with an increase in abundance of Phylum Tenericutes, Class Mollicutes, Order Aneroplasmatales, and Genus Aneroplasma, and a decrease in Order Clostridiales, and Genus Dehalobacterium, when compared to OVX+VEH controls. The metabolomic profile showed an increase in some tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)-related metabolites accompanied by a reduction in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyric acid in OVX+END mice. Additionally, the mitochondrial and ATP production of immune cells was enforced to a maximal rate in OVX+END mice when compared to OVX+VEH mice.

10.1093/humrep/dead252,Endometriosis-related infertility: severe pain symptoms do not impact assisted reproductive technology outcomes.,ResearchPaper,"Do severe endometriosis-related painful symptoms impact ART live birth rates?
Severe pain symptoms are not associated with reduced ART live birth rates in endometriosis patients.
ART is currently recognized as one of the main therapeutic options to manage endometriosis-related infertility. Presently, no data exist in the literature regarding the association between the core symptom of the disease, e.g. pain and ART reproductive outcomes.
Observational cohort study of 354 endometriosis patients, who underwent ART at a tertiary care university hospital, between October 2014 and October 2021. Diagnosis of endometriosis was based on published imaging criteria using transvaginal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and histologically confirmed in women who had a previous history of endometriosis surgery (n = 127, 35.9%).
The intensity of painful symptoms related to dysmenorrhea (DM), dyspareunia (DP), noncyclic chronic pelvic pain, gastrointestinal (GI) pain, or lower urinary tract pain was evaluated using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS), before ART. Severe pain was defined as having a VAS of 7 or higher for at least one symptom. The main outcome measure was the cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) per patient. We analyzed the impact of endometriosis-related painful symptoms on ART live births using univariable and multivariate analysis.
Three hundred and fifty-four endometriosis patients underwent 711 ART cycles. The mean age of the population was 33.8 ± 3.7 years, and the mean duration of infertility was 3.6 ± 2.1 years. The distribution of the endometriosis phenotypes was 3.1% superficial endometriosis, 8.2% ovarian endometrioma, and 88.7% deep infiltrating endometriosis. The mean VAS scores for DM, DP, and GI pain symptoms were 6.6 ± 2.7, 3.4 ± 3.1, and 3.1 ± 3.6, respectively. Two hundred and forty-two patients (68.4%) had severe pain symptoms. The CLBR per patient was 63.8% (226/354). Neither the mean VAS scores for the various painful symptoms nor the proportion of patients displaying severe pain differed significantly between patients who had a live birth and those who had not, based on univariate and multivariate analyses (P = 0.229). The only significant factors associated with negative ART live births were age >35 years (P < 0.001) and anti-Müllerian hormone levels <1.2 ng/ml (P < 0.001).
The diagnosis of endometriosis was based on imaging rather than surgery. This limitation is, however, inherent to the design of most studies on endometriosis patients reverting to ART first.
Rather than considering a single argument such as pain, the decision-making process for choosing between ART and surgery in infertile endometriosis patients should be based on a multitude of aspects, including the patient's choice, the associated infertility factors, the endometriosis phenotypes, and the efficiency of medical therapies in regard to pain symptoms, through an individualized approach guided by a multidisciplinary team of experts.

It is a complex disease that presents with a range of symptoms, with pain and infertility being the most common. Along with severe dysmenorrhea, cyclic and acyclic lower abdominal pain, cyclic dysuria and dyschezia, dyspareunia, and infertility, there are also nonspecific complaints that can cause confusion and make endometriosis the chameleon among gynecological diseases. These symptoms include unspecific intestinal complaints, cyclic diarrhea, but also constipation, nausea, vomiting, and stomach complaints. It appears that in addition to general bowel symptoms, there are also specific symptoms related to endometriosis such as cyclic bloating of the abdomen, known as endo belly. During the second half of the menstrual cycle leading up to menstruation, the abdomen becomes increasingly bloated causing discomfort and pain due to elevated sensitivity of the intestinal wall. Patients with endometriosis exhibit a reduced stretch pain threshold of the intestinal wall. Here, we review the endo belly, for the first time, pathophysiology and the influence of other diseases (such as irritable bowel syndrome-IBS), microbiome, hormonal levels, inflammation, and diet on the presentation of this condition.",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-11-25 00:00:00,"['Renata VoltoliniVelho', 'FranziskaWerner', 'SylviaMechsner']"

To date, invasive surgery is the method of choice to visually and histologically confirm endometriosis. Thus, there is a major interest to develop noninvasive diagnostic tools. Oxidative stress is one of the proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis and may be involved in pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility in endometriosis patients. Thus, markers of oxidative stress may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis.
This prospective case-control study assessed erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX), serum hexanoyl lysine (HEL) and peritoneal fluid HEL.
We enrolled 86 women with primary infertility; the case group included 57 women with endometriosis, and the control group included 29 women with unexplained primary infertility. All the patients underwent laparoscopy, and the diagnosis was confirmed histologically. RANDOX and RANSEL reagents were used to determine the levels of SOD and GPX, respectively, and ELISA was used to determine the levels of HEL.
We found no statistically significant differences in the erythrocyte levels of GPX (

Resulting endometrial nodules may develop on the uterosacral ligament, urinary tract, rectovaginal, and retrocervical areas, and less commonly in the urinary bladder, thoracic, and neural regions. Genetics, age, and environmental factors determine the progression of the disease. DIE manifests with numerous symptoms, which are similar to unrelated diseases, namely dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary tract infections, and infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and physical examination may detect and differentiate endometriosis lesions from other diseases. Its clinical management typically involves laparoscopic surgery and hormonal therapy. These are designed to improve the quality of life and to address individual reproductive goals.

10.3390/ijerph19116725",Insight into the Potential Mechanisms of Endocrine Disruption by Dietary Phytoestrogens in the Context of the Etiopathogenesis of Endometriosis.,ResearchPaper,"Phytoestrogens (PEs) are estrogen-like nonsteroidal compounds derived from plants (e.g., nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables) and fungi that are structurally similar to 17β-estradiol. PEs bind to all types of estrogen receptors, including ERα and ERβ receptors, nuclear receptors, and a membrane-bound estrogen receptor known as the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). As endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with pro- or antiestrogenic properties, PEs can potentially disrupt the hormonal regulation of homeostasis, resulting in developmental and reproductive abnormalities. However, a lack of PEs in the diet does not result in the development of deficiency symptoms. To properly assess the benefits and risks associated with the use of a PE-rich diet, it is necessary to distinguish between endocrine disruption (endocrine-mediated adverse effects) and nonspecific effects on the endocrine system. Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease of unknown etiopathogenesis, in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) grows outside of the uterus with subsequent complications being manifested as a result of local inflammatory reactions. Endometriosis affects 10-15% of women of reproductive age and is associated with chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility. In this review, the endocrine-disruptive actions of PEs are reviewed in the context of endometriosis to determine whether a PE-rich diet has a positive or negative effect on the risk and course of endometriosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-08-12 00:00:00,['DariuszSzukiewicz']

Primary results of our randomized controlled trial (RCT) on adhesion prevention after deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) resection using the gel barrier 4DryField
This RCT comprised 50 patients. Preoperatively and after 1, 6 and 12 months, pain scores for cycle-independent pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and dysuria, as well as the number of pregnancies, were recorded,.
The pregnancy rate in the intervention group was significantly higher (

We conduct a review of the literature documenting the female reproductive health impacts of Long COVID which may include disruptions to the menstrual cycle, gonadal function, ovarian sufficiency, menopause, and fertility, as well as symptom exacerbation around menstruation. Given limited research, we also review the reproductive health impacts of overlapping and associated illnesses including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), and endometriosis, as these illnesses may help to elucidate reproductive health conditions in Long COVID. These associated illnesses, whose patients are 70%-80% women, have increased rates of dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, dyspareunia, endometriosis, infertility, vulvodynia, intermenstrual bleeding, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids and bleeding, pelvic congestion syndrome, gynecological surgeries, and adverse pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, maternal mortality, and premature birth. Additionally, in Long COVID and associated illnesses, symptoms can be impacted by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. We propose priorities for future research and reproductive healthcare in Long COVID based on a review of the literature. These include screening Long COVID patients for comorbid and associated conditions; studying the impacts of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause on symptoms and illness progression; uncovering the role of sex differences and sex hormones in Long COVID and associated illnesses; and addressing historical research and healthcare inequities that have contributed to detrimental knowledge gaps for this patient population.",Frontiers in rehabilitation sciences,2023-05-26 00:00:00,"['BethPollack', 'Emeliavon Saltza', 'LisaMcCorkell', 'LuciaSantos', 'AshleyHultman', 'Alison KCohen', 'LetíciaSoares']"

Endometriomas are most commonly found in the ovaries. Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women and is a common cause of chronic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Most commonly, endometriosis is found within the pelvis, specifically on the ovaries.  Endometriomas are the most common manifestation of endometriosis on the ovary. However, implants can also be found throughout the abdomen, such as on the bowel, within prior surgical incisions, and even in rare cases in distant locations of the body, such as the cerebellum. Approximately 17 to 44% of women diagnosed with endometriosis will experience an endometrioma. These lesions are commonly referred to as chocolate cysts due to the thick dark brown appearance of the fluid contained within them. Endometriomas indicate a more severe disease state in patients with endometriosis and can lead to specific issues, such as decreased ovarian reserve.",nan,2025-01-01 00:00:00,"['Abigail T.Hoyle', 'YanaPuckett']"

10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.11.030",A Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews on the Use of Aromatase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Endometriosis: The Evidence to Date.,ResearchPaper,"Endometriosis is a chronic gynecologic condition that affects around 6-10% of reproductive age women. This clinical entity is characterized with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility which are the most often presenting symptoms. Aromatase P450 is the key enzyme for ovarian estrogen biosynthesis and there is evidence that endometriotic lesions express aromatase and are able to synthesize their own estrogens. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are potent drugs that suppress the estrogen synthesis via suppression of aromatase. We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews and narrative reviews on the use of aromatase inhibitors in the medical management of endometriosis. We searched: PubMed (1950-2022), Google Scholar (2004-2022), Cochrane Library (2010-2022) and Researchgate (2010-2022). The search included the following medical subject headings (MeSH) or keywords: ""Aromatase Inhibitors"" AND ""Endometriosis"" AND ""Systematic reviews"" OR ""Systematic review"" AND ""Reviews"" OR ""Reviews"" AND ""Endometriosis"". The electronic database search yielded initially 12,106 studies from the different databases. Further assessment of the studies resulted in exclusion of (n = 12,015) studies due to duplicates and irrelevance; Finally, 24 studies were selected for inclusion, 5 were Systematic reviews and 19 were Narrative reviews. The 5 systematic reviews were assessed by AMSTAR-2 criteria and were found to have low quality. Narrative reviews were assessed with SANRA criteria and were found to have high-quality aromatase inhibitors are potent drugs that can manage the endometriosis-related symptoms in cases where initial medical management has failed to show positive results. However, their use is limited by the adverse effects that are linked with menopausal symptoms. aromatase inhibitors can be administered as an alternative treatment in patients. Future studies with randomized design are required to reach safer conclusions and further investigation. These studies should define the therapeutic dose, new add-back therapy modalities. Future directions should examine the most-appropriate way of administration and the duration of therapy.","Drug design, development and therapy",2023-05-12 00:00:00,"['PanagiotisPeitsidis', 'PanagiotisTsikouras', 'Antonio SimoneLaganà', 'AlexandrosLaios', 'Ioannis DGkegkes', 'ChristosIavazzo']"
10.1080/13697137.2023.2190882,Evaluation and management of endometriosis.,ResearchPaper,"The initial diagnostic investigations for endometriosis are physical examination and pelvic ultrasound. The pelvic examination should include a speculum examination and vaginal palpation. Mobility, fixation and/or tenderness of the uterus and site-specific tenderness in the pelvis should be evaluated. Transvaginal ultrasound and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging are recommended to evaluate the extent of the endometriosis and to determine whether any urinary tract or bowel procedures might also be required during surgical resection. Quality of life should be assessed by using the Endometriosis Health Profile-30, its short version EHP-5 or the generic quality of life questionnaire SF-36. Management of endometriosis is recommended when it has a functional impact (pain, infertility) or causes organ dysfunction. Many gynecological societies have published different guidelines for the evaluation and management of endometriosis. However, the complexity of this disease together with the different available treatments lead to significant discrepancies between the recommendations. Postmenopausal endometriosis should be considered when a patient has a history of symptoms before menopause including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Malignant transformation of endometriosis is estimated to occur in about 0.7-1.6% of women affected by endometriosis. Endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, specifically clear cell, endometrioid and low-grade serous types.",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2023-04-14 00:00:00,['TYoldemir']

It is a multifactorial disease involving genetic, hormonal, immunological and environmental components. Endometriosis's pathogenesis remains unclear.
was to analyse the polymorphisms in Interleukin 4, Interleukin 18, FCRL3 and sPLA2IIa genes to identify any significant association with the risk of endometriosis.
This study evaluated the polymorphism of -590 C/T in interleukin- 4(IL-4) gene, C607A in Interleukin - 18(IL-18) gene, -169T > C in FCRL3 gene and 763 C > G in sPLA2IIa gene in women with endometriosis. The case-control study included 150 women with endometriosis and 150 apparently healthy women as control subjects. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and endometriotic tissue of cases and blood samples for controls and further analysed by PCR amplification and then sequencing was carried out to find the allele and genotypes of the subjects and then to analyse the relationship between the gene polymorphisms and endometriosis. To evaluate the association of the different genotypes, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Interleukin - 18 and FCRL3 gene polymorphisms of endometriotic tissue and blood samples of endometriosis (cases) showed significantly associated (OR = 4.88 [95% CI = 2.31-10.30], P > 0.0001) and (OR = 4.00 [95% CI = 2.2-7.33], P > 0.0001) when compared with normal blood samples. However, there was no significant difference in Interleukin - 4 and sPLA2IIa gene polymorphisms between control women and patients with endometriosis.
The present study suggests that the IL-18 and FCRL3 gene polymorphisms are associated with a higher risk for endometriosis, which delivers valuable knowledge of endometriosis's pathogenesis. However, a larger sample size of patients from various ethnic backgrounds is necessary to evaluate whether these alleles have a direct effect on disease susceptibility.",Molecular biology reports,2023-03-12 00:00:00,"['NandhiniBalunathan', 'UshaRani G', 'VenkatachalamPerumal', 'PKumarasamy']"
10.1016/j.jmig.2023.01.006,True Prevalence of Diaphragmatic Endometriosis and Its Association with Severe Endometriosis: A Call for Awareness and Investigation.,ResearchPaper,"To identify characteristics indicating preoperatively the presence of diaphragmatic endometriosis (DE).
Comparison of characteristics of patients with diaphragmatic endometriosis (DE) with characteristics of patients with abdominal endometriosis without diaphragmatic involvement, in a prospective cohort study.
Tertiary referral center; endometriosis center.
A total of 1372 patients with histologically proven endometriosis.
Surgery performed laparoscopically under general anesthesia. All patients with suspected endometriosis underwent a complete bilateral inspection of the diaphragm.
Demographic and clinical pathologic characteristics were evaluated using basic descriptive statistics (comparison of the groups using the χ2 test and the Mann-Whitney t test). A logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship (hazard ratio) between symptoms and the presence of DE. DE was diagnosed in 4.7% of the patients (65 of 1372). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (patients with abdominal endometriosis with or without DE) with regard to typical endometriosis pain (dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dysuria, and/or dyspareunia). However, in the DE group, diaphragmatic pain was present significantly more often preoperatively (27.7% vs 1.8%, p <.001). Four DE patients (6.1 %) were asymptomatic (with infertility the indication for surgery). In the DE group, 78.4 % had advanced stages of endometriosis (revised American Fertility Society III° or IV°); the left lower pelvis was affected in more patients (73.8%). In cases of ovarian endometriosis, patients with DE showed a significantly higher prevalence of left ovaries involvement (left 63% vs right 35.7%, p <.001). Patients with DE had a significantly higher rate of infertility (49.2% vs 28.7%, p <.05).
Patients with shoulder pain, infertility, and/or endometriosis in the left pelvis have a significant higher risk of DE and therefore need specific preoperative counseling and if indicated surgical treatment.",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2023-01-21 00:00:00,"['FlaviaPagano', 'AdrianaSchwander', 'CloéVaineau', 'LauraKnabben', 'KonstantinosNirgianakis', 'SaraImboden', 'Michael DMueller']"
